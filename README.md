# slack-teams

###### Scripts we will use to help BNC volunteers effectively use Slack to communicate with each other and track their progress organizing events.

Will eventually include:
* A Slackbot which greets volunteers when they join the Slack team, and helps them get set up with all instructions.
* Google AppsScripts which allow us to add features to Google Forms that volunteers fill out to update BNC staff on their progress organizing events.
* Other relevant glue scripts.
